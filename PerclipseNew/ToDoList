To Do - List (updated 28.07.2009)
- Error updater should be finished and e.g. display the exception type
- The result output, which is currently displayed on console, should be depicted in an eclipse view
- In the progress view the user should be able to double-click a method and then the method would be open in an editor (like junit)
- Maybe we could display further information in the progress view, e.g. meters
- Currently the plug-in is tested on eclipse 3.4 Ganymede. We should it test on the latest eclipse version 3.5 alias Galileo
- We should produce the first release
- The plug-in should be offered online as an eclipse update-site
- Additional stuff..
