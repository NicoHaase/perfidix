~~ --><h1>Usage</h1><div class="section"><h2>Description<a name="Description"></a></h2><p>Using Perfidix is quite straight-forward and even easier if you are familiar with Unit-Testing like JUnit. The aim of Perfidix is to reduce any generation of benchmarking code but to utilize existing testing-code: What is more convenient than to use Unit-tests?</p></div><div class="section"><h2>Annotations<a name="Annotations"></a></h2><p>Perfidix relies on the following two components:</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>The execution framework (either our Eclipse Plugin Perclipse) or a container class</p></li>
  <li><p>Annotations for methods and classes to be benchmarked</p></li>
</ul><p>While the first component relies on classes, the second component consists out of Annotations applicable on all methods which are parameter-free and void. Similar to JUnit, setup and teardown methods can be applied to the benchmarks even though Perfidix offers finer granularity of those utility methods.</p><p>The annotations including suitable parameters are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>@BenchClass  Has to be placed before the class declaration Each void-method without parameters and any bench annotation is benched</p></li>
  <li><p>@BenchClass(runs=)  Sets the number of runs for all benchs Can be overridden by the Bench-annotation with own run-parameter</p></li>
  <li><p>@BeforeFirstBenchRun Executed before every bench-method and after the BeforeBenchClass-annotated method Executed for all bench-methods but just once for all runs</p></li>
  <li><p>@BeforeEachBenchRun  Executed before every bench-method and after the BeforeFirstBenchRun-annotated method  Executed for all bench-methods before every run</p></li>
  <li><p>@Bench Annotates the method to bench @Bench(beforeFirstBenchRun=) Specific setUp-method for this bench for settings before the bench is executed once for this bench</p></li>
  <li><p>@Bench(beforeEachBenchRun=) Specific setUp-method for this bench for settings before the bench is executed for every run for this bench</p></li>
  <li><p>@Bench(afterEachBenchRun=) Specific tearDown-method for this bench after the bench is executed after every run for this bench</p></li>
  <li><p>@Bench(afterLastBenchRun=) Specific tearDown-method for this bench after the bench is executed after the last run of this bench</p></li>
  <li><p>@Bench(runs=) Sets the number of runs for this method. Overrides the default value and a possible setting from a BenchClass annotation of the corresponding class.</p></li>
  <li><p>@AfterEachBenchRun Executed after every bench-method Executed for all bench-methods after every run</p></li>
  <li><p>@AfterLastBenchMethod Executed after every bench-method and after the AfterEachBenchRun-annotated method Executed for all bench-methods after the last run</p></li>
  <li><p>@AfterBenchClass Executed after the last bench-method and after the AfterLastBenchRun-annotated method Executed once per class</p></li>
  <li><p>@SkipBench Will be ignored by perfidix except the method is invoked as a specfic setUp-/tearDown method Useful in combination with the BenchClass annotation and a specific setUp-/tearDown method of one bench.</p></li>
</ul></div><div class="section"><h2>Execution<a name="Execution"></a></h2><p>The methods, marked by the defined annotations, need to be executed by a suitable framework aware of the meters to benchmark on the one hand plus the outputs to be generated on the other hand. The execution takes place either by a provided Eclipse-Plugin or by a suitable Benchmarking-Object executable as normal Java-program.</p>
