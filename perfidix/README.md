Perfidix - No discussions, Just facts.

6 steps how to use Perfidix:
- Download the latest .jar from sourceforge or check out the latest build from the repository
- Insert the jar into your classpath
- Annotate your methods to bench with "@Bench". Note that these methods have to have the following layout: "public (final) void method()" 
- Create a new "Benchmark" object and add the class with the annotated methods to it.
- Get the BenchmarkResult by typing "benchmarkObj.run()"
- Display the result with the TabularSummaryOutput.visit(benchmarkResultObj).
