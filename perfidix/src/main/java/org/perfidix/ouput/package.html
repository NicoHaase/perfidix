<h2>Perfidix Result</h2>
<p>The whole results are stored in this structure. It is a recursive build of three containers:
 one for the Benchmark, one for the containing classes and the last one for the Methods.
  Each container has several Collections for the different meters. Statistical output is computed on the fly without 
  any caching because of the listener architecture.</p>
