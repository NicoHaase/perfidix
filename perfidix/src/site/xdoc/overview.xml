			<p>Perfidix is a tool for developers to conveniently and consistently
				benchmark Java code. It can quickly answer which implementation is
				faster. Without the need to launch a full-fledged profiling
				application or rewrite the same Java code to measure the execution
				time again and again.</p>

			<p>Eventhough Perfidix is simple to use, it still provides a sound
				statistical output for taking a decision.</p>

			<subsection name="JUnit like handling">
				<p>
					Perfidix is intentionally designed to be used like
					<a href="http://www.junit.org">JUnit 4.x</a>
					i.e., it provides annotations to discover which methods should be
					benchmarked how many times. The eclipse plugin or custom code
					allows to run a package, class, or method as a Perfidix benchmark
					and to collect the execution time statistics for each method in the
					console as text or CVS output.
				</p>
				<p>The output includes package, class, and method name together with
					the number of runs, min, max, average, standard deviation, and
					confidence intervals. The number of runs can individually be
					specified per package, class, or method. Besides this, the number
					of runs can be chosen by a probability distribution function to
					simulate typical workloads.</p>
			</subsection>
			<subsection name="Do a quick benchmark, analyze later.">
				<p>
					Perfidix was created at the
					<a href="http://www.uni-konstanz.de/">University of Konstanz</a>
					at the
					<a href="http://www.informatik.uni-konstanz.de/arbeitsgruppen/disy/">Distributed System Group</a>
					.
				</p>
				<p>It greatly assisted the research by allowing for quick
					benchmarking of different algorithms and data structures.
					Furthermore, all benchmark results could easily be made persistent
					for later analysis and compilation into charts.</p>
				<p>
					Perfidix is hosted with
					<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/perfidix/">Sourceforge</a>
